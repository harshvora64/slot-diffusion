# Object-Centric Learning with Slot Attention and Diffusion Models

This project implements object-centric representation learning using Slot Attention and Diffusion Models, tested on the CLEVRTex dataset. The goal is to decompose images into interpretable object representations and generate new compositional attributes.

## Features
- Slot Attention for interpretable image decomposition.
- Diffusion-based decoding for enhanced generative capabilities.
- Training and evaluation with metrics like ARI and clean FID.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-repo.git
   cd project-repo

2. Download the sub-sampled CLEVRTex dataset from the kaggle notebook link: https://www.kaggle.com/code/cs1210548/slot-diffusion
